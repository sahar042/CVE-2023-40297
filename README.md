Attack vector(s):
https://<domain/ip>/%5C../etc/passwd

An attacker can exploit the directory traversal vulnerability by manipulating the URL to traverse outside the intended web directory.

This allows the attacker to obtain privileged information about system users, potentially facilitating further attacks.
