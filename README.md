Attack vector(s):
https://<domain/ip>/%5C../etc/passwd

An attacker can exploit the directory traversal vulnerability by manipulating the URL to traverse outside the intended web directory. By appending "%5C../etc/passwd" to the URL, an unauthorized user can access the sensitive system file "/etc/passwd" containing user account information. This allows the attacker to obtain privileged information about system users, potentially facilitating further attacks.
